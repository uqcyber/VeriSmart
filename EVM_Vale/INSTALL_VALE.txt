This is a document to outline the steps of installing Vale from source:

https://github.com/project-everest/vale/blob/master/INSTALL.md (referred to as documentation) has most of what you need to install, but there will be a few hints here to help.

1. (Same as documentation) Install scons and add to the path if not automatically added to path
2. Install F#, Nuget, FsLexYacc (.NET seems to handle these)
2. Clone Vale repository (referred to as vale/)
3. vale/run_scons.sh line 8 has a variable for the python version vale is expecting to be installed, if you have a diffrent version from 3.6 you should update it. (I don't know if this has potential to cause other issues, but I did this and things worked for me)
4. run scons
4.1 if error such as csc.exe or fsc.exe not found from SConscript, Vale is trying to build but is unable to path to .NET things like the F# compiler. 
- TRIED installing .NET latest SDK -> FAILED doesn't have fsc.exe
- TRY https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp clone and install directly

WINDOWS INSTALL ABANDONED, NEED SOLUTION TO fsc.exe

LINUX:
1. Follow instructions on Vale install page (downloading dependencies)
2. Clone Vale
3. vale/run_scons.sh line 8 has a variable for the python version vale is expecting to be installed, if you have a diffrent version from 3.6 you should update it. (I don't know if this has potential to cause other issues, but I did this and things worked for me)
4. run scons
5. Place z3 4.8.5 binary in Tools/z3 (Note that if the binary is in a subfolder, you need to add that aswell). Otherwise z3 4.8.5 can be on the PATH
6. Place F* (whole package with ulib, not just binary) in Tools/FStar
7. run "scons --FSTAR --FSTAR-MY-VERSION"
8. Contact Daniel if problems occur
